    <h4>Personality: </h4>
    Generally considered dogkind's finest all-purpose worker, the German Shepherd Dog is a large, agile, muscular dog of noble character and high intelligence. Loyal, confident, courageous, and steady, the German Shepherd is truly a dog lover's delight.
<h4>Living With:</h4>
Your Shepherd doesn't just love his humans, he adores them. He wants to be with you all the time. Not that you must constantly pay attention to him; just lying at your feet or watching you from across the room will do quite nicely. On the other hand, if you insist on talking on the phone for longer than half an hour, be prepared for a gentle nose nudge telling you that enough’s enough. Your Shepherd also will be more than happy to sleep on your couch or in your bed if you allow such things. Just because he weighs 60-90 pounds doesn’t mean he doesn’t enjoy being a lapdog. He does. Big time!
